  Gatsby's Fashion Portfolio Starter
</h1>

A Gatsby starter for a professional and minimal fashion portfolio.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using gatsby-starter-fashion-portfolio 
    gatsby new my-fashion-portfolio https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-fashion-portfolio
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-fashion-portfolio /
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!


## 🎨 Make it your own?

1.  **Putting your own images in**

    a. For the Home Page, replace the image `image-home-page` in the `images` folder with your own ( keeping the name intact as `image-home-page`) <br/>
    b. The images on Collections Page follow the patterns as below - <br/>
>      i. `page-[page-number]-thumb` for thumbnail images
>      ii. `page-[page-number]-large` for large images
>      iii. `page-[page-number]-grid-[grid-index]` for grid images
    c. Replace the images with the above patterns.


1.  **Putting your own Logo in**

    Update the component in `src/Logo` with your text or image.
